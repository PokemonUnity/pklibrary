The event's rectangle is positioned such that its bottom left corner is where the event has been placed in the map. A "large" event behaves as you would expect: no part of it can move onto a non-passable tile or another event (unless its "Through" setting is set), the player and other events cannot move into any part of the large event, and the player can interact with any part of it. If its event name contains "Trainer(3)" or "Counter(3)", it can detect whether the player moves into any of the tiles in front of any part of it.   <a href="class_pokemon_unity_1_1_character_1_1_entities.cshtml#afaf2ab2e3654436bcc8182cc8bcaaf3f">More...</a><br /></td></tr>

<p>An event with this text in its name has a "line of sight", which is a set of tiles in front of it that it can "see".If the player walks into this line of sight, the event will be triggered as though it was interacted with.The event must be looking in the direction of the player in order to be triggered; unlike the "Trainer(3)" text, this text does not require the event to be able to walk up to the player in order to trigger.An event using this functionality must also have the "Event Touch" trigger. The number in the brackets is how far in front of itself the event can see(in tiles). It can be any number greater than 0.  </p>
<p >This text is named because it is usually used for events standing behind desks or counters that need to detect when the player tries to walk past(e.g.a guard in a gatehouse at the end of a Cycling Road, who will prevent the player from proceeding if they don't have a Bicycle). </p>

<p>An event with this text in its name is treated as occupying multiple tiles at once(in this case, a rectangle 2 tiles wide and and 3 tiles tall). The event's rectangle is positioned such that its bottom left corner is where the event has been placed in the map. A "large" event behaves as you would expect: no part of it can move onto a non-passable tile or another event (unless its "Through" setting is set), the player and other events cannot move into any part of the large event, and the player can interact with any part of it. If its event name contains "Trainer(3)" or "Counter(3)", it can detect whether the player moves into any of the tiles in front of any part of it.  </p>
<p >If the event is given a graphic which is a tile from the tileset, its graphic will be a set of tiles equal to its size, with the chosen tile being the bottom left one of that set. For example, you can make an event depicting a rock of size(2,2) by using this text to make it that size, giving it a graphic of the bottom left tile of that rock from the tileset, and placing the event where the bottom left corner of the rock sits in the map. The the whole event will use the passability/terrain tag/other tile properties of just the selected tile; if the other tiles used by the event in its graphic have different tile properties, they will be ignored. </p>
